# React Writer

This project is a confluence of two different things I want to do: Write Fiction and Write Code.

What I'd like to do is keep adding features to this so please let me know if there's anything you'd like to see added by entering an issue.

## To Run
First clone and npm install and all that. Don't forget to create your own .env file with your own MongoDB URI

To start the backend server, cd to the backend folder and run:
### `nodemon server`

Then start up the React front end by running this from the project root directory:
### `npm start'

In the project directory,  run:

### `npm start`
